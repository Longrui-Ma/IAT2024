## Same as before, with a fundamentally different environment
- Implement Q-learning in the cartpole environment. Take some time to think about the applicability of your current code. What are state and action spaces?
- See https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/ for a documentation on the cartpole environment.

## Deep reinforcement learning for cartpole
- Read and complete reinforce.py. We here implement the Reinforce algorithm presented in the slides; representing the policy by a neural network
